SRGAN-based Image SR improved by HRNet semantic segmentation

SR Module based on
[Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802)

and Segmentation module based on 
[Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07919)

Thanks @stefanopini for simplificated HRNet module implementation! https://github.com/stefanopini/simple-HRNet

Thanks @leftthomas for a readable SRGAN implementation! https://github.com/leftthomas/SRGAN
